    "This notebook is essentially the \"lite\" version of SFS. With it you can easily determine the number of primary quanta for a given event in a LXe TPC (interaction type, drift field, energy deposition, sample size) utilizing NEST. You need to have NEST installed on your local machine.\n",
    "\n",
    "All you need to do is to adapt the input of the chapter 1 cells (comments tell you what to do) and run the whole notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "What this notebook cannot do:\n",
    "- include detector properties in order to obtain S1 and S2 signal in terms of photoelectrons instead of primary quanta (The primary quanta are independent from detector properties, e.g. lce, qe, ce, ...)\n",
    "- spectra processing (You need a MC processor for such things. Maybe take a look at Signal Formation or ask the DARWIN MC team (i.e. Yanina).)\n"
